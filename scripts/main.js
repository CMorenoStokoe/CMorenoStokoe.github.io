Main script
---------------

Intended purpose of this script:
- Build the graphical user interface (GUI)
- Facilitate gameplay controls and amend data as required

Contents of this script:
- Initialisation
    Functions which only run once at the start to initialise the GUI and gameplay

- Interactive gameplay functions
    Functions which run multiple times, triggered on player interactions (e.g., enacting policies)

Encapsulation:
- This master file runs functions found in other script files containing 
collections of methods categorised by purpose.
